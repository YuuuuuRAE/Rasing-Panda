Informations about the eye wink script:
The script is already added as a component on your panda-prefab. 
The mesh "Panda Eyes" is chosen as renderer (can be assigned by drag and drop or by clicking on the small circle on the right). You can define a close eye time, an open eye time and an open eye time delta. The pandaÂ´s closed eye - texture, which is defined in the last line, changes with the open eye - texture.
